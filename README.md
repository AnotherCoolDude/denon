# Denon

Like Nodemon, but for Deno.

## Install

To install Denon simply enter the following into a terminal:

```deno install . denon https://denolib.com/eliassjogreen/denon/denon.ts --allow-read --allow-run -- -- --```

Yeah the last part is funky but it works at least...

## Usage

To use Denon simply think of `denon` as an alternative to `deno run` which accepts all the same flags

## Todo

- [ ] Help dialog
- [ ] Configuration flags
- [ ] Configuration file?
- [ ] Non-deno scripts
- [ ] Mapping file extensions to certain scripts
- [ ] Multiple directories
- [ ] Using denon from deno
- [ ] "Fullscreen" mode using console.clear each time its rerun
