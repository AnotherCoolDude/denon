# Denon

Like Nodemon, but for Deno.

## Install

To install Denon simply enter the following into a terminal:

`deno install . denon https://denolib.com/eliassjogreen/denon/denon.ts --allow-read --allow-run -- -- --`

Yeah the last part is funky but it works at least...

## Usage

To use Denon simply think of `denon` as an alternative to `deno run` which accepts all the same flags etc.
